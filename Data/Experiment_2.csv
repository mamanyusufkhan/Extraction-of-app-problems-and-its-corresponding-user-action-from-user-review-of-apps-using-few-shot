"This app is infuriating. I tried to transfer money to my friend, but the process was a nightmare. First, the app crashed multiple times while trying to access my contacts. When it finally worked, the app couldn't recognize my friend's username despite it being correct. After several attempts, the transfer finally went through, but then I noticed that the app had deducted the amount twice from my account! I contacted customer service, but they were unresponsive. Avoid this app at all costs.","[{'app crashes': ['transfer money to a friend']}, {""can't recognize username"": ['transfer money to a friend']}, {'deducted amount twice': ['transfer money to a friend']}]"
"Terrible experience trying to pay my utility bill using this app. The app froze while entering my payment details and then crashed completely. After restarting, I had to re-enter all my information, only to get an error message saying the payment could not be processed. I checked my bank account and saw that the amount had been deducted anyway. Now I'm stuck with a pending payment and no way to resolve it because customer support is unreachable. Absolutely unacceptable.","[{'app freezes': ['enter payment details for utility bill']}, {'app crashes': ['enter payment details for utility bill']}, {'payment deducted but not processed': ['enter payment details for utility bill']}]"
"I tried booking a flight and hotel package, and it was a complete disaster. The app kept timing out during the search process, and when it finally found options, it wouldn't let me select the flight I wanted. After several retries, I managed to get to the payment screen, but the app wouldn't accept my credit card information, saying it was invalid. I used the same card on another site without any issues. To top it off, when I checked my email, I had multiple confirmations for the same booking, all charged to my card. Now I'm dealing with the hassle of cancellations and refunds. Frustrating beyond belief.","[{'app times out': ['search for flight and hotel package']}, {""won't accept credit card information"": ['enter payment information for flight and hotel package']}, {'multiple confirmations and charges': ['book flight and hotel package']}]"
"Trying to book a rental car was a nightmare. The app was painfully slow, and every time I selected a car, it would say 'car not available' after going through all the details. When I finally found one that seemed available, the app crashed at the payment stage. After restarting, it showed the car as booked, but I never received a confirmation email. Customer service is useless – they claim there's no record of my booking even though my card was charged. This app is unreliable and a huge waste of time.","[{'app is slow': ['select rental car']}, {'car not available error': ['select rental car']}, {'app crashes': ['make payment for rental car']}, {'no confirmation email': ['book rental car']}]"
"I tried to log my workout, and it was a frustrating experience. The app took forever to load and then crashed as soon as I tried to enter my exercise details. When I finally got it to stay open, it wouldn't save my workout and kept giving me a 'network error' despite having a strong Wi-Fi connection. After several attempts, it eventually saved my workout twice, but with incorrect data. The syncing with my smartwatch is also hit-or-miss. Extremely disappointing.","[{'app takes forever to load': ['log workout']}, {'app crashes': ['log workout']}, {'network error': ['save workout']}, {'incorrect data saved': ['save workout']}]"
"Logging meals on this app is a joke. The barcode scanner rarely works, and when it does, the nutritional information is often wrong. Manually entering meals is no better – the app frequently crashes or freezes, and the database of foods is incomplete. On top of that, the app failed to sync with my fitness tracker, so my calorie count is always off. Customer support has been no help, just generic responses that don't address the issues. This app is more hassle than it's worth.","[{'barcode scanner rarely works': ['log meals']}, {'nutritional information is wrong': ['log meals']}, {'app crashes or freezes': ['manually enter meals']}, {'database of foods is incomplete': ['log meals']}, {'failed to sync with fitness tracker': ['log meals']}]"
"Terrible app. I tried to purchase a few items, but the experience was horrendous. The app kept removing items from my cart randomly. When I tried to proceed to checkout, it gave me an error message saying some items were out of stock, even though they were still listed as available. After finally managing to place the order, the payment screen glitched and charged my card twice. Now I'm dealing with double charges and missing items from my order. Customer service is not responding to my emails. Never using this app again.","[{'app removes items from cart': ['add items to cart']}, {'error message saying items out of stock': ['proceed to checkout']}, {'payment screen glitches and charges card twice': ['make payment']}, {'missing items from order': ['place order']}]"
"Horrible user experience trying to order a gift. The app was incredibly slow, and every time I added something to my cart, it took forever to update. When I went to checkout, the app crashed repeatedly. After finally getting through, my payment was declined for no apparent reason, even though my card is fine. When I tried a different card, it went through, but the order status shows pending for days now. No updates, no tracking info, and customer support is non-existent. Extremely frustrating.","[{'app is slow': ['add items to cart']}, {'app crashes': ['checkout']}, {'payment declined for no reason': ['make payment']}, {'order status shows pending for days': ['place order']}]"
"Terrible service. The internet is constantly dropping, and when it does work, it's painfully slow. Customer service is useless – long wait times and no resolution to the issues. I've been overcharged multiple times, and getting a refund is a nightmare. Switching to a different provider ASAP.","[{'internet constantly drops': ['use internet']}, {'internet is painfully slow': ['use internet']}, {'long wait times for customer service': ['contact customer service']}, {'no resolution to issues': ['contact customer service']}]"
"Very disappointed with FastNet. The connection is unreliable, and the speeds are nowhere near what was advertised. The installation process was a hassle, and the technician was late.

"I tried to sign up for a new account and the app was a mess. It kept saying my email was invalid even though it was correct. When I finally got past that, the verification code never arrived in my inbox. After requesting it multiple times, I received several codes at once, none of which worked.

"Booking a concert ticket through this app was a disaster. First, the app crashed multiple times while searching for events. When it finally loaded, the seat selection was glitchy and wouldn't let me choose my preferred seats. After several tries, I managed to book a ticket, but then the app double-charged my card. Now I have two charges and only one ticket. Unacceptable.","[{'app crashed': ['search for events']}, {'glitchy seat selection': ['choose preferred seats']}, {'double-charged card': ['book a concert ticket']}]"
"I attempted to update my profile picture, but the app was incredibly buggy. It took forever to load the photo gallery, and when I finally selected a picture, it either failed to upload or uploaded a distorted version. I tried several times with the same result. Also, it logged me out unexpectedly during the process.

"Trying to check my account balance was a nightmare. The app was extremely slow to open, and when it finally did, it showed incorrect balance information.

Unreliable and frustrating.","[{'app slow to open': ['check account balance']}, {'incorrect balance information': ['check account balance']}, {'app crashed': ['navigate through menus']}]"
"I tried to book a table at a restaurant, and the app failed miserably. It kept showing 'no availability' for times that were clearly open on the restaurant's website. When I finally got a reservation, the app crashed and didn't save it. I had to start over, and it happened again. I ended up calling the restaurant directly. A total waste of time.","[{'no availability shown': ['book a table at a restaurant']}, {'app crashed': ['save reservation']}, {'had to call restaurant directly': ['book a table at a restaurant']}]"
"Downloading a PDF document using this app was impossible. The download button was unresponsive, and when it finally worked, the app crashed halfway through the download.

"I tried to update the app to the latest version, but it was a disaster. The update process froze multiple times and eventually corrupted the app, making it unusable. I had to uninstall and reinstall it, losing all my saved data in the process. The new version also has more bugs than the old one.

"Attempting to log my sleep data with this app was a nightmare. The app was slow to open and kept crashing when I tried to enter my sleep hours.

"I attempted to use the app to track my package delivery, but it was useless. The app was extremely slow to load the tracking information, and when it did, it was outdated and incorrect.

"Attempting to reset my password was a nightmare. The app constantly gave me an 'error' message when I tried to submit my new password.

"Trying to book a doctor's appointment was infuriating. The app kept giving me errors when I selected available times.
